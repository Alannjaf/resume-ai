## Development Environment
- I always run the server and build on windows also when I give you image paths it windows path you have to change it to wsl path becuase you are running on wsl
- keep in mind claude is running in wsl of windows and for build and npm dev commands I will run on windows cmd manually

## Code Organization
- Make sure each file of code not to be more than 100 lines of code otherwise refactor to multiple files with max 100 lines of code
